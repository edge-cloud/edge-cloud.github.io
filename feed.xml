      <content type="html">Today we will look at some of the fundamental principles of IP routing. While these principles and concepts are generic, we will use examples based on AWS networking. This blog post is not intended to be an all encompassing primer on IP routing. Instead I’ve seen numerous people confused by some of these principles and concepts while either designing networks or troubleshooting them. Therefore it appears to be a good idea to highlight and explain...</content>

      <content type="html">Recently AWS released support for IPv6 traffic over the AWS Site-to-Site VPN (IPSec). The setup of the AWS Site-to-Site VPN has always been quite straight forward and thanks to the downloadable configuration files at times even trivial. With the introduction of IPv6 support this is unfortunately no longer the case. Therefore this blog post will guide you around some of the pitfalls of setting up an AWS Site-to-Site VPN with IPv6 support, hoping that they...</content>
